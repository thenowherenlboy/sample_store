Zenva Node.js Sample Store with enhancements

Base structure from the Zenva Academy Course "Server-Side Rendered Webapps with Node.js, Express and MongoDB" (https://academy.zenva.com/course/server-side-rendered-webapps-with-node-js-express-and-mongodb/)

### Enhancements include:
- navbar partial with selective rendering (via replacing the npm module hjs with hogan-express, albeit I am not entirely sure that was necessary)
- Added product Remove Buttons for both users and administrators
- Added file upload for picture files to be displayed with products (admin page) with placeholder for products with no picture
